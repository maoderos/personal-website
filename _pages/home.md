### About me

I am an undergraduate Physics student at UFRGS since 2017. I started to research in Particle Physics in 2019 through the study of air showers using Geant4 and since then I became passionate by the topic. My most recent studies are on the performance of the ALPIDE sensor for low energy ions and the validation of electron energy deposition through the Geant4 simulation toolkit. Alongside with research in Physics, learning about linux, programming skills, computational tools and open-source softwares are also my interests.
